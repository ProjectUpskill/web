## Deciding on an Egg
The first step to cooking an egg is to actually buy some eggs. The differences between eggs are:

### Caged Eggs:
  - If the egg doesn't say what type it is, it is probably from a chicken that was raised in a cage. 
  - We do not recommend caged eggs in general due to animal welfare concerns, and also, they tend to taste worse.

### Free-range Eggs:
   - These eggs are from chickens that are allowed to roam around.
   - They have a bit more freedom and are a good middle ground egg.

### Organic Eggs:
   - Depending on where you are, this label may mean different things, but generally means free-roaming chickens. 
   - You should do some research if you wish to buy organic eggs.

# Storing Eggs
## Storing Eggs Safely
   - In some places in the world, such as the US, you are advised to keep your eggs in the fridge due to concerns about bacteria. 
   - In other parts of the world, you can safely keep your eggs out on the counter.


# Soft/Hard Boiled

1. To cook an egg by boiling it, start off by boiling a pan full of water, about half way up the pan. 
2. Once you have done this, put the egg in and boil it for 4 minutes for a soft boiled, or 6 minutes for a hard boiled egg. 
3. Turn off the heat and take it out using a spoon, break the shell by peeling it, and add a pinch of salt and pepper.

# Scrambled Eggs

1. To scramble an egg, put a bit of oil or butter in a frying pan and turn on the heat. 
2. Next, crack an egg open by banging it against the frying pan and breaking the shell. 
3. Then, slowly open the egg's contents onto the frying pan and stir it with a wooden spoon. 
4. Keep stirring it until the egg white is no longer runny when you poke it with the wooden spoon. 
5. Turn off the heat after 2-4 minutes and add a pinch of salt and pepper.
